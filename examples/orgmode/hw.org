* What is this document?

This is a demonstration of my homework \LaTeX{} class. It is an extension of the ~amsart~ and should have all of its functionality. These are some of the set symbols: $\C \supset \R \supset \Q \supset \Z \supset \N \supset \P$, then some Greek and other mathematical symbols are, $\al, \ep, \p, \ra, \Ra, \injective, \surjective, \bijective$. We can also insert multiple figures as seen in figure [[fig:kwarizmi]]. There is also an ~org-mode~ version of this file[fn:0].

* Prove that square root of two is irrational.

We show,
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Proof by Contradiction]
#+BEGIN_proof
Square root of two is irrational, $\sqrt{2} \not\in \Q$.

Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{2} = p/q$ for some integers $p,q$ with no common factors. Then $2q^2 = p^2$ so $p$ is even. I. e., $p=2k$ for some $k$. Then $q^2=2k^2$, so $q$ is also even which is a contradiction.

* What is the cardinality of Natural Numbers?
  <<cardinality>>

It is $\aleph_0$ [[cite:arlinghaus1996part]]. See also question [[custom-index]].

* [IV] Is the cardinality of Naturals and Reals the same because they are both infinite?
<<custom-index>>

No, the cardinality of Reals is greater because they are also un-listable (uncountable). See also question [[cardinality]].

* Finally the numbered bullets are done with the ~enumitem~ package,

1. With just bullets,
   - *Cats*
   - /Dogs/

* [1 (Bonus)] State chain rule.

Chain Rule:
\[
\zeta(x) = f(g(x)) \quad \text{ then according to the chain rule: } \quad
\derivative{\zeta} = \derivative[g]{f} \times \derivative{g}
\]

* [2 (Bonus)] Euclidean Algorithm

You may write code as in listing,

#+BEGIN_export latex
\lstinputlisting[language=python, label=gcd, caption=Euclidean Algorithm for Greatest Common Factor]{../../media/sample.py}
#+END_export

* How do we insert in-file code?

Like in listing [[fib-recur]],

#+NAME: fib-recur
#+CAPTION: Recursive Python function to calculate $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options numbers=left
#+BEGIN_src python :results output
def fib(n):
  if n == 0: return 0
  if n == 1: return 1
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
print(fib(20))
